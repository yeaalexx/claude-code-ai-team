# Global AI Team Knowledge Base

> This file persists learnings from Claude + Grok collaboration across ALL projects.
> Every project benefits from every other project's discoveries.
> Claude reads this at session start and appends after significant collaborations.

## How This Works
- **Global learnings go HERE** — patterns, best practices, debugging insights, corrections
- **Project-specific context** stays in each project's `AI_TEAM_SYNERGY.md`
- Claude reads this file at the start of every session in every project
- After a significant Grok collaboration, Claude appends the learning here

## Architecture & Design Patterns
<!-- Cross-project architecture learnings. Format: [DATE] Project: X -- Lesson -->

## Code Patterns & Best Practices
<!-- Language-agnostic or cross-project coding patterns -->

## Debugging Insights
<!-- Bugs, gotchas, and fixes that apply broadly -->

## Domain Knowledge
<!-- Industry/domain learnings that may apply across projects -->

## AI Collaboration Meta-Learnings
<!-- How Claude and Grok work best together -- prompt strategies, when to consult, etc. -->

## Corrections & Disagreements
<!-- When one AI corrected the other -- prevents repeating mistakes -->

## Technology-Specific Notes
<!-- Reusable knowledge about specific tools, frameworks, libraries -->
